The aim of this experiment is to interface a DC motor with a Raspberry Pi using a relay module, enabling control of the motorâ€™s operation through the General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins of the Raspberry Pi. This setup demonstrates the capability of the Raspberry Pi to control high-power electrical components indirectly through relays, using Python-based programming logic. The experiment also explores the safe switching of AC/DC loads using a low-power microcontroller.
