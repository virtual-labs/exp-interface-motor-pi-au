### Theory

* DC motor - Any of a group of rotating electric motors that use direct current (DC) electricity to create mechanical energy is referred to as a DC motor. The most prevalent kinds depend on the forces created by induced magnetic fields brought on by current flowing through the coil. For a portion of the motor's current to sometimes shift direction, almost all types of DC motors contain an internal mechanism that is either electromechanical or electronic.

* Relay switch - The electro-mechanical relay is a type of output device (actuator) that may be used in a wide variety of electrical circuits. It is available in a wide variety of forms, sizes, and designs. But even if electrical relays may be used to turn relatively high currents or voltages "ON" or "OFF" in low power electronic or computer type circuits, a relay switch circuit must be employed to do so.The advantage of relays is that it takes a relatively small amount of power to operate the relay coil. However, a relay switch circuit can be used to control motors, heaters, lamps or AC circuits which themselves can draw a lot more electrical voltage, current and therefore power.

* Bread Board - Temporary circuits are constructed using a breadboard, often known as a plugblock. Designers may quickly remove and change components because to its usefulness. It is helpful for someone who wants to construct a circuit to show how it works before reusing the parts in another Circuit.
